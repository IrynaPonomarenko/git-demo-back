I know that I
Have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
 know that I
Am on a fast track to the grave, and I'm headed there alone
I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that isn't me
I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way
To get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself
Yeah!
I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way
To get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I need to find
A way back inside my mind
